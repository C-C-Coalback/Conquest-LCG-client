# Conquest-LCG-client

The WH40k Conquest client will be able to create decks and draw the game-state.

By connecting to the server, it will be able to play the game with other players.

Update: Probably won't create decks.

Currently client is able to display the screen. Needs code to send
the ids of what was clicked on back to server.
Note that the ids are not just x y coords, but are instead more akin
to a description of the position clicked on.
