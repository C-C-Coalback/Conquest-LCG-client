# Conquest-LCG-client

The WH40k Conquest client will be able to create decks and draw the game-state.

By connecting to the server, it will be able to play the game with other players.

This repo is now entirely defunct. The project is being continued at the repo for [the website](https://github.com/C-C-Coalback/Conquest-LCG-Site).
