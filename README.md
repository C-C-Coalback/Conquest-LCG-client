# Conquest-LCG-client

The WH40k Conquest client will be able to create decks and draw the game-state.

By connecting to the server, it will be able to play the game with other players.

Update: Oops haven't updated the readme in a while. Should explain where it is at.
It has also been a while since I last updated the projects since I have been busy with Uni + Winter break.

Client should be fully done in terms of playing the game; players are able to see each other in lobbies
and send game invites to each other (max one invite per player at a time to prevent potential problems).

In-game, when the player clicks on the screen, the client calculates what exactly was clicked on (hand, headquarters,
in-play, as well as relevant position), then send this to the server. The server handles all the checks for if the target was valid or not.

More importantly, I am going to try to make a website for the game, using Django. I am not going to start it yet; I need to get some practice in with
MUCH simpler Django web sites before I even try something that complex. Zero clue how long this will take; if I get it done in a month that would be a
major victory in my book.
